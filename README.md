# Segmentation of bacteria using synthetic images
Code for creating binary images of bacteria, as described in the paper [Segmentation of dense and multi-species bacterial colonies achieved using models trained on synthetic microscopy images](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2405.12407).

The corresponding data is available on [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/records/14841299). See also https://github.com/abid1214/cyclegan for code used to perform image-to-image translation on synthetic images.

Python code is also included to analyze densely packed monolayers of rod-shaped cells and to compare masks from different segmentation models to ground truth masks, as described in the paper.
